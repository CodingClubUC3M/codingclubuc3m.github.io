**Abstract:** Teaching Innovation is a must nowadays and new educational techniques such as Active Learning requires an invesment in technology. An application is a tool that allows us to conect the student with some task that are out of their scope. 

In this session, the main goal is to convince a regular R user of being able to develop his/her own interactive (web) application without much effort. For doing so, we introduce the Shiny R package that makes this task simple even for a R programmer that has never heart about HTML, CSS or JavaScript (or does not care about them at all). Along the session, we will develop a simple app from the scratch which will allow us to understand input and ouput objects as well as the whole workflow intuition of an interactive Shiny app.

We invite to the audience to bring a (simple) R of code for thinking about how to develope your own Shiny App.
