**Abstract:** The first time you read about the ```Julia``` language, the idea that sticks in your mind is "A speed similar to ```C```, with a simplicity similar to ```MATLAB```". And in that sentence, the key point is the word "similar", because the differences in the language with ```MATLAB``` or ```R``` might be quite stressful when things do not work as expected. This talk is just a summary of ideas and code with which I would have wished to be introduced into this language to avoid some headaches and scary error messages.
