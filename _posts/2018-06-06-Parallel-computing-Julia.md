**Abstract**

In this session, we will be learning how to parallelize code in ```Julia```. Through different examples, we will cover from the most basic ideas (e.g.: sending work to different processes) to more advanced ones (e.g.: automatically sequence tasks in parallel). The tutorial ends with a parallel implementation of the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm.
