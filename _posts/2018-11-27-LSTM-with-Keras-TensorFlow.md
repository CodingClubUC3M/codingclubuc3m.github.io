**Abstract**: This is the contribution to the [Coding Club UC3M](https://twitter.com/CodingClubUC3M). The aim is to show the use of `TensorFlow` with `KERAS` for classification and prediction in Time Series Analysis. The latter just implement a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model (an instance of a Recurrent Neural Network which avoids the vanishing gradient problem).
