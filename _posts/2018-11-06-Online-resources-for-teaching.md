 **Abstract**: In this session, I will try to show some teaching on the web utilities present. One of them will help us to execute `R` code from the web, using an online compiler, without installing any kind of software in our computers. The other one can help us to solve optimization problems in a graphical way, allowing to draw the restrictions, the feasible regions, and other elements that we may need to solve the optimization problems. Finally, I will show other helpful tools for teaching.
