(**Edited November 25, 2015.**)  I stand in awe of the R wizards who post their latest and greatest <a href = "http://shiny.rstudio.com" target ="_blank">Shiny</a> feats on R-Bloggers.  It's taken me a while to find my way around Shiny, but at last I feel ready to fill in a few gaps for others who may be just starting out and who aspire to write reasonably involved, user-friendly simulation apps.  To make it a bit more fun I've written it up as an R Markdown document.

I used to host the document on `shinyapps.io`, but it pushed my monthly hours over their limit.  You can get the source code, however, from the <a href="https://github.com/homerhanumat/shinyTutorials" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.  Check the repo's Readme for prerequisites and instructions on access.

If you have feedback or suggestions for improvements, comment here or post an Issue on the GitHub site.  Happy learning!
