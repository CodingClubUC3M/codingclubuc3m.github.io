# Hoang

- Checked English and formatting of the post? No, so time to do it.
- Check English template (rent? rendered!, ListS)
- Why linebreaks in the template if not meant for spaces? Confusing
- Need better font formatting: e.g. R -> `R`, `@codingclaubuc3m` -> [`@codingclubuc3m`](Twitter link), `LaTeX` or $\LaTeX$
- Use backticks to refer to computer language or specific technologies
- You write the template, you author it
- Remove the "Depacito" link (is DeSpacito)
- Better format of images
- Video only with HTML or R Markdown
- Commas before code -> . or :
- Explain better the code format for specific languages.
- More descriptive template [E.g. "Your abstract of the talk goes here. We will describe some basics of markdown to illustrate its usage blah blah blah"]
- References?
- Inline math?
- Tables?
- Link to the posts folder in the repo for examples?
- Markdown ">"

# General

- Implication in the future of the Coding Club UC3M?
- Need to show more willingness to do things better... The two attempts for building this template is an example. We are in a team and we all have to put input, no free lunch.
